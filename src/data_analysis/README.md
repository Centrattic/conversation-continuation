To add: PCA plot of conversations colored by person & groups of 6 months - have we changed over time?

### Some data stats
* Mistral was trained on potentially 7T tokens (https://huggingface.co/manu/mistral-7B-v0.1)
* My finetuning (at least the first 14000 rows of data) is like 26494 tokens - whoa, 25K vs. 7T ðŸ¤¯
- this gives some intuition maybe as to why adding a special token for our names is a bad idea/didn't work too well ?zs m
